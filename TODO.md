# TODO

 - [ ] Add more tests
 - [ ] Add option to disable color
 - [ ] Use better sorting func defining
 - [ ] Autocleaning should have an option to remove binary (non ascii) files
 - [ ] Eventally, autocleaning should run if needed during running if total space is grader than an amount
 - [ ] Should keep a track file of the total space used in a ini format so users can also see it (this way it will
       be easy to know when to run the autocleaning, see todo item above)
 - [ ] Should have a `SRM_TRASH` env var or something to specify the trash path
 - [ ] Use a table printer for srm list
 - [x] Add hidden flag `-l` and print message to use `+l` command
